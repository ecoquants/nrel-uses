# General

- Alternative to raster approach: summarize by "BOEM Block Aliquots", except only for West & East territories.

TODO:
- fetch latest from MarineCadastre and merge into `data/categories_and_datasets.xlsx`.

# Layers

## `efh`

TODO:
- categorize sublayers for other territories besides West & Alaska.

## `shippinglanes`

- Not as comprehensive as B&V. See PILE graphic vs MarineCadastre.
