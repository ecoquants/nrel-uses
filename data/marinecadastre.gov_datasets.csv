2009-2010 Commercial Vessel Density (October - AIS),"These data were generated to provide insight into traffic patterns on a macro scale so they could be analyzed across the coastal waters of the Continental United States. For this dataset, a transit is counted for every unique vessel intersecting a 1 kilometer square grid cell each day. This data represents the total number of vessel transits from October 2009 - October 2010. There were some grid cells which were unable to be processed, but it is not perceived that this interferes with the integrity of these data.

Please note multiple connection errors occurred during the time frame of this study. In most cases, data gaps were filled by making subsequent requests to the Coast Guard or other groups receiving the same data feed. However, due to resource constraints, uninterrupted coverage was not obtained. Overall data outages were minimal, on the order of less than a day per month. Because outages were random and affect all areas uniformly, they do not have a significant effect on the integrity of the data. As stated on the USCG NAIS website, AIS data are not representative of all vessel traffic and USCG NAIS receivers do not fully cover the entire extent of this study area.

Abandoned Shipwreck Act,"This data represents the extent of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act (ASA). The ASA allows states to manage a broad range of resources within submerged lands, including abandoned shipwrecks that have been deserted and to which the owner has relinquished ownership rights with no retention. With the exception of wrecks on certain federal public lands, the ASA asserts U.S. title to abandoned shipwrecks and automatically transfers the title to coastal states. Citing to the Submerged Lands Act, the ASA generally extends seaward a distance of three nautical miles from the coastline to the inner limit of the outer continental shelf. In the cases of Texas, the Gulf coast of Florida, and Puerto Rico, the ASA extends seaward three marine leagues—or nine nautical miles—from the coastline.

Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships and MARPOL 73/78,"In 1973, the International Maritime Organization adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships and subsequently modified it by Protocol in 1978.  The Convention is widely known as MARPOL 73/78.  Its objective is to limit ship-borne pollution by restricting operational pollution and reducing the possibility of accidental pollution.  MARPOL 73/78 consists of six separate Annexes – each sets out regulations covering the various sources of ship-generated pollution.  Currently, the United States is signatory to Annexes I, II, III, V and VI.  Annexes I, II, V and VI have been incorporated into U.S. law by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and implemented within 33 U.S.C. § 1901 and 33 C.F.R. Part 151.  The AAPS was subsequently amended by the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (1987) and the Marine Pollution Prevention Act (2008).

Artificial Reefs,"An artificial reef is a human-made underwater structure, typically built to promote marine life in areas with a generally featureless bottom. Many reefs are built using objects that were built for other purposes, like sinking oil rigs through the Rigs-to-Reefs program or shipwrecks when preserved on the sea floor. Other artificial reefs are purpose built like reef balls from PVC or concrete. Artificial reefs generally provide hard surfaces where algae and invertebrates such as barnacles, corals, and oysters attach; the accumulation of attached marine life in turn provides intricate structure and food for assemblages of fish.
This is NOT a complete collection of artificial reefs on the seafloor, nor are the locations to be considered exact.

"Atlantic Fishing Revenue Intensity, 2007-2012","This is a single data set from a larger study. The full study is titled ""Socio-Economic Impact of Outer Continental Shelf Wind Energy Development on Fishing in the U.S. Atlantic"". Each quarter square km (500 m) cell has been summed for the mean correlated economic value over the six year period analyzed (2007-2012). This information was created for each state, gear type, Fishery Management Plan (FMP), top 30 exposed ports and top 30 exposed species. This was calculated using Vessel Trip Reports (VTR), Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) which estimates radial distance within which fishing activity is likely to occur, and a 500 m raster cell output. The value is in US dollars for 2012 representing the sum of the mean values for all six years, and then classified into one of the 8 classes.

"Blue Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities. This work represents an important step towards understanding marine mammal habitat use with respect to regions utilized by the U. S. Navy.

"Fin Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities. This work represents an important step towards understanding marine mammal habitat use with respect to regions utilized by the U. S. Navy.  MarineCadastre.gov has included Blue, Fin, Humpback, and Sperm whale models for the summer months as examples of these models.  Please view the publication for specific details on the development and use of these models.

Fish Species Richness,"This layer provides access to a fish species richness map made available by the Marine-life Data and Analysis Team (MDAT) led by the Duke University Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, and including NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and Loyola University Chicago. For all sampled fish species together, total richness maps are calculated in a GIS by stacking each individual species’ sampled presence (created from the Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation layers) and counting the total number of species present in each cell. A species is considered present in a cell if the interpolated biomass is above a certain very low threshold. That threshold is determined by defining the smallest area holding 95% of the total interpolated biomass for the species. The legend for this map shows the estimated number of expected species for a tow in a grid cell (10km x 10km).

Fish summary products were developed using the NEFSC fall survey data source only. Fish group species richness represent the expected richness of a survey trawl done in that area, and are not representative of the true fish species richness in that location. This is the expected richness for the gear type used in NEFSC fall trawls, and does not account for each species’ catch-ability. These data are a fishery descriptor, not an ecosystem descriptor and are not meant to be used to determine absolute fish biomass hotspots.

Fish Total Biomass,"This layer provides access to a fish biomass map made available by the Marine-life Data and Analysis Team (MDAT) led by the Duke University Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, and including NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and Loyola University Chicago. For all sampled fish species together, total biomass maps are calculated in a GIS by stacking each individual species’ Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation layers and summing the values of the cells. The result is the total interpolated biomass of all individuals of the sampled species in that cell, for example forage fish. Note that individual fish species IDW maps calculate biomass on a natural logarithm scale, and these aggregate maps are raw biomass, in kilograms. The legend for this map shows the sum of the IDW fish biomass for all species and for all tows in each grid cell (10km x 10km).

Fish summary products were developed using the NEFSC fall survey data source only. The summary map products provide a means to distill multiple layers and time periods into simplified maps and build a general understanding of the ecological richness or abundance in a particular area. Development of these maps required decisions and thresholds that are explained in the Metadata and Publication links. These decisions were made after conducting research, testing of several options, and incorporating feedback from expert work group members. Understanding these decisions and thresholds is crucial to proper interpretation of these map products.

High Frequency Radar Locations,"This dataset show the point locations of High Frequency (HF) radar systems across the US. HF radars measure the speed and direction of ocean surface currents in near real time. These radars can measure currents over a large region of the coastal ocean, from a few kilometers offshore up to 200 km, and can operate under any weather conditions. They are located near the water’s edge, and need not be situated atop a high point of land. Dozens of institutions own and operate HF radars within the United States, and many are coordinated through the US Integrated Ocean Observing System. Ocean surface current data from these radars are shared on national servers by the National Data Buoy Center and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. If specific information regarding a local radar system is needed, please contact Dr. Jack Harlan, Project Manager for the HF Radar Ocean Remote Sensing, US IOOS Program Office.",U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System,http://www.ioos.noaa.gov/,http://cordc.ucsd.edu/projects/mapping/,1,https://coast.noaa.gov/dataservices/Metadata/TransformMetadata?u=https://coast.noaa.gov/data/Documents/Metadata/harvest/MarineCadastre/HighFrequencyRadarLocations.xml&f=html,1
"Humpback Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities. This work represents an important step towards understanding marine mammal habitat use with respect to regions utilized by the U. S. Navy.  MarineCadastre.gov has included Blue, Fin, Humpback, and Sperm whale models for the summer months as examples of these models.  Please view the publication for specific details on the development and use of these models.

Individual Fish Species,"This entry provides access to the individual fish data made available by the Marine-life Data and Analysis Team (MDAT) led by the Duke University Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, and including NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and Loyola University Chicago. NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center led the MDAT effort to summarize fish biomass and distribution, as part of their ongoing Ecosystem Assessment work on the Northeast Continental Shelf. There are four sources for fisheries trawl data: the NEFSC, North East Areas Monitoring and Assessment Program (NEAMAP), Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (MDMF), and Maine & New Hampshire state trawls (ME/NH). There is some spatial overlap among the surveys, and the NEFSC survey area is much larger than any of the others. Each survey program has used standardized survey designs and data collection methodologies but some have used different vessels and gears over time. Results have been normalized to account for these vessel and gear differences within each data source, however no method has yet been applied to normalize data across the different sources. For that reason, the services are presented separately in the Map Service link under MDAT/Fish. Uncertainty is estimated as the variance of the total fish biomass per tow within each hexagon and those are also available in the map service folders.

Marine Minerals Significant Sand Resource Blocks,"This layer contains OCS block outlines and delineated polygons, for the BOEM Gulf of Mexico Region, containing sediment resources and areas of disposal. Coastal restoration, beach nourishment, and levee reconstruction are crucial to mitigate future coastal erosion, land loss, flooding, and storm damage. Success of that long-term effort depends on locating and securing significant quantities of OCS sediment resources compatible with the target environments being restored. Offshore sand resources are extremely scarce where most needed. Vast areas of these relatively small offshore sand resources are not extractable because of the presence of oil and gas infrastructure, archaeologically or biologically sensitive areas. BOEM, through its Marine Minerals Program, is implementing several measures to help safeguard the most significant OCS sediment resources, reduce multiple use conflicts, and minimize interference with oil and gas operations under existing leases or rights-of-way.

National Seafloor Geology (GLORIA),"In 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) began a program to map deep water portions of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) by selecting the long-range side scan sonar system GLORIA (Geological Long-Range Inclined ASDIC).
The USGS selected side-scan sonar as the mapping tool because it could be used to obtain information on geologic processes. The intensity of back-scattered sound from the seafloor is a function of the gradient or slope of the seafloor, surface roughness, and sediment characteristics such as texture.  The darkness or brightness of a feature or an area on the sonographs and completed mosaics is therefore a function of how much sound is reflected from the seafloor.

Ocean Disposal Sites,"In 1972, Congress enacted the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA, also known as the Ocean Dumping Act) to prohibit the dumping of material into the ocean that would unreasonably degrade or endanger human health or the marine environment. Virtually all material ocean dumped today is dredged material (sediments) removed from the bottom of waterbodies in order to maintain navigation channels and berthing areas. Other materials that are currently ocean disposed include fish wastes, human remains, and vessels. Ocean dumping cannot occur unless a permit is issued under the MPRSA. In the case of dredged material, the decision to issue a permit is made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, using EPA's environmental criteria and subject to EPA's concurrence. For all other materials, EPA is the permitting agency. EPA is also responsible for designating recommended ocean dumping sites for all types of materials. Disposal sites with a status of “Available” are available for use and these include all selected and designated sites. Sites with a status of “Discontinued” include all discontinued, historical, or terminated sites. The site with a status of “prohibited” are not available for use, dumping is prohibited. Finally, when the source information did not explicitly state the status of a site, the status was listed as “unknown”.",MarineCadastre.gov,http://www.marinecadastre.gov/,ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/OceanDisposalSites.zip,1,https://coast.noaa.gov/dataservices/Metadata/TransformMetadata?u=https://coast.noaa.gov/data/Documents/Metadata/harvest/MarineCadastre/OceanDisposalSites.xml&f=html,1
Ocean Sediment Thickness Contours,"Ocean sediment thickness contours in 200 meter intervals for water depths ranging from 0 – 18,000 meters. These contours were derived from a global sediment thickness grid distributed by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). The NGDC grid was compiled from various existing sediment thickness maps and drilling cores, and has a cell resolution of 5 arc seconds. Sediment thickness data is typically acquired through two methods. Seismic (or sub-bottom) profile technologies rely on powerful pulses of low-frequency sound which penetrate the substrate and return information about substrate thickness, character, and stratification. The data are collected along transect lines and require interpolation to create comprehensive maps. Sediment thickness is also determined by direct measurement through coring, which provides more detailed information but only at discrete sites. Coring data can also be interpolated to form area maps, and to help interpret the seismic data.",MarineCadastre.gov,http://www.marinecadastre.gov/,ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/OceanSedimentThicknessContours.zip,1,https://coast.noaa.gov/dataservices/Metadata/TransformMetadata?u=https://coast.noaa.gov/data/Documents/Metadata/harvest/MarineCadastre/OceanSedimentThicknessContours.xml&f=html,1

In accordance with accepted global practice, wave power density is measured in kilowatts per meter of wave crest aggregated across a unit diameter circle. Data were classified using quantiles.
Bathymetric effects are known to have a large effect on wave characteristics at depths shallower than ~20m on the east coast and ~50m on the west coast. Reliable site-specific information in shallow waters can only be produced using results from models with higher spatial resolution that include shallow-water physics.

Pennatulacea,"The data represent predicted habitat suitability for several taxa of deep-sea corals. Predictions were modeled using a statistical machine-learning algorithm called maximum entropy (MaxEnt). NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) combined databases of known deep-sea coral locations provided by the NOAA Deep-Sea Coral Research and Technology Program (DSCRTP) and other contributors with environmental and oceanographic data to generate the predictive models of deep-sea coral distribution. These models are used to produce regional maps of deep-sea coral habitat.  In these regions, deep-sea coral occurs on the continental shelves and slopes, at ocean depths of approximately 50 to greater than 2,000 meters.  
Model predictions are organized into five hierarchical categories to be able to compare the data across coral taxa and across regions.  The categories correspond to the predicted likelihood of suitable deep sea coral habitat occurring.

Proposed Coastal Critical Habitat Areas,"When a species is proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service must consider areas of habitat believed to be essential to the species’ conservation, and propose those areas as critical habitat. This dataset, last updated in March 2017, is a compilation of the proposed critical habitat areas from NOAA and USFWS listed species in coastal areas. 

To become officially designated as critical habitat, an area is published as a proposed Federal regulation in the Federal Register. After a period of public review, the comments are adjudicated and the final boundaries of the critical habitat area are published in the Federal Register. When areas are officially designated, they move into the Coastal Critical Habitat Designations layer on MarineCadastre.gov. Because MarineCadastre.gov updates data on a pre-defined cycle, it is possible that proposed layers have been adopted or removed prior to being reflected in this layer.  It is important to keep in mind that these maps are only for illustrative purposes. Federal Register text descriptions should be used for authoritative purposes.

Shipping Lanes and Regulations,"Shipping zones delineate activities and regulations for marine vessel traffic. Traffic lanes define specific traffic flow, while traffic separation zones assist opposing streams of marine traffic. Precautionary areas represent areas where ships must navigate with caution, and shipping safety fairways designate where artificial structures are prohibited. Recommended routes are predetermined routes for shipping adopted for reasons of safety. Areas to be Avoided are within defined limits where navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and should be avoided by all ships or certain classes of ships. Shipping Lanes and Regulations layer was created by extracting ENC (.000) files published by Marine Chart Division, OCS, NOAA. The web service was developed by CSDL/OCS/NOAA.

"Sperm Whale, Pacific Summer Density","The Navy and other military users of the marine environment are required to assess the impact of their activities on marine mammals to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. The number of marine mammals that might be impacted by Navy activities must be estimated in an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement.  A key element of this estimation is knowledge of cetacean densities in specific areas where those activities will occur.  Data collected by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) from 1986-2006 using accepted, peer-reviewed survey methods were used to develop models to forecast cetacean densities. This work represents an important step towards understanding marine mammal habitat use with respect to regions utilized by the U. S. Navy.  MarineCadastre.gov has included Blue, Fin, Humpback, and Sperm whale models for the summer months as examples of these models.  Please view the publication for specific details on the development and use of these models.

Superfund Sites,"This layer represents active Superfund Sites published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These data were extracted from the Superfund Enterprise Management System. In 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) to address the dangers of abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste dumps by developing a nationwide program for: emergency response; information gathering and analysis; liability for responsible parties; and site cleanup. CERCLA also creates a Trust Fund (or 'Superfund') to finance emergency responses and cleanups. EPA's Superfund program has helped protect human health and the environment by managing the cleanup of the nation's worst hazardous waste sites and responding to local and nationally significant environmental emergencies.

The purpose of the study was to begin to identify potential space-use conflicts between OCS renewable energy development and other uses of the ocean environment and recommend measures that BOEM can implement in order to promote avoidance or mitigation of such conflicts, thereby facilitating responsible and efficient development of OCS renewable energy resources. The ethnographic data was created by engaging individuals and small groups in one on one guided discussions, and making handwritten shapes on paper maps to depict fishing locations. These commercial and recreational fishing locations have since been condensed into a single layer.  These are displayed by showing the sum of reported species for a particular area.",Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,http://www.boem.gov/,ftp://ftp.coast.noaa.gov/pub/MSP/WestCoastFishingEthnography.zip,1,https://coast.noaa.gov/dataservices/Metadata/TransformMetadata?u=https://coast.noaa.gov/data/Documents/Metadata/harvest/MarineCadastre/WestCoastFishingEthnography.xml&f=html,1
West Coast Mid-Water Trawl Fishing Extent (2002-2006),"This data layer depicts the spatial extent of commercial mid-water trawling off the U.S. West Coast from 1 Jan 2002 – 11 Jun 2006. Records of mid-water trawl tows were compiled from two data sources: 1) Logbook data originating from the state logbook programs and uploaded to the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) regional database, and 2) observer records from the At-Sea Hake Observer Program (A-SHOP). These two data sources represent the shoreside and at-sea hake fleets, respectively. Included in the A-SHOP data are observations of tribal fishing in the at-sea hake sector.",NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service,http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/,http://mustang.coas.oregonstate.edu/EFH_Downloads/T2/midtrawlBefor_ExtentPolygon.zip,1,http://efh-catalog.coas.oregonstate.edu/metadata/461/5,1

"West Coast Recreational Fishing Closures, 2015","These data delineate state and federally managed ocean areas off the West Coast of the United States that are closed to or have restrictions on recreational fishing for fish and invertebrates as of June 2015. These areas include marine protected areas, marine reserves, essential fish habitat conservation areas, and other types of conservation areas. Closures and restrictions may be year-round or seasonal. The data do not include all spatially explicit fishing regulations. The focus of these data is on fishing closures and restrictions that generally persist through time, and do not include many fishing management measures that are used to open and close areas dynamically to manage species, harvests, and seasons. Some areas where access is prohibited or restricted are included because these act as “de-facto"" closures or restrictions to fishing.",Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,http://www.boem.gov/,http://www.boem.gov/Fishing-Closures-Map-Package/,1,https://coast.noaa.gov/dataservices/Metadata/TransformMetadata?u=https://coast.noaa.gov/data/Documents/Metadata/harvest/MarineCadastre/WestCoastFishingClosures2015.xml&f=html,1
"West Coast Rockfish Conservation Areas, 2015","These data delineate Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCA) off the West Coast of the United States for 2015.  There are three types of areas closures depicted in this layer: Commercial Trawl Non-Groundfish, Commercial Trawl Groundfish, and Commercial Non-Trawl Groundfish. These areas represent closures to commercial fishing for non-groundfish with trawl gear, closed to commercial fishing for groundfish with trawl gear, or areas are closed to commercial fishing for groundfish with non-trawl gear, respectively. Closures may vary seasonally. Boundaries are lines that connect a series of coordinates that approximate particular depth contours. North/south boundaries are designated by specific lines of latitude. Keep in mind that Rockfish Management Areas are fairly dynamic and may change as often as 5 times per year.

Wrecks and Obstructions,"In 1981, NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS) implemented the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) to assist in planning hydrographic survey operations and to catalog and store a substantial volume of reported wrecks and obstructions that are considered navigational hazards within U.S. coastal waters. As part of the hydrographic survey planning process, these records are reviewed and those records which require additional field investigation are assigned to specific field units for verification. The results of these investigations eventually become part of the AWOIS record so that a permanent history of a wreck or obstruction is always available.
AWOIS is not a comprehensive record of wrecks in any particular area. There are wrecks in AWOIS that do not appear on the nautical chart and there are wrecks on the nautical chart that do not appear in AWOIS. Updates to AWOIS are ongoing; however, it will never completely address every known or reported wreck.
